# uav-position-verification-simulator

## Getting started
This repository requires at least `python 3.11.1`. Install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt`.

## Running
The entry point for the simulator is the `main.py` file. Here, the whole study with all its parameters is defined. To execute a single run, execute `python3 main.py 0 0`.

## Results
Running a simulation creates a subfolder under `res/` and deposits result files there. In the `analysis` folder are several jupyter notebooks for result processing.
